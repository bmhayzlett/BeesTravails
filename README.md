"Welcome to Bee's Travails! The Traveling Salesman is a very famous computer science problem. This app demonstrates the 'brute force' solve method, which tests every single possible path. This algorithm has O(n!) time complexity, so each additional flower vastly increases the solve time. Be careful! If you select 10 flowers, you might wait a while while your computer performs 3.6 million calculations!"

This plot shows points used to test the path algorithm. Point A is the
starting point, and point E is the ending point. There are 6 paths between
the two points, and path A -> B -> C -> D -> E is the shortest path.
