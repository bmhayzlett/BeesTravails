"Welcome to Bee's Travails! The Traveling Salesman is a very famous computer science problem. This app demonstrates the 'brute force' solve method, which tests every single possible path. This algorithm has O(n!) time complexity, so each additional flower vastly increases the solve time. Be careful! If you select 10 flowers, you might wait a while while your computer performs 3.6 million calculations!"
